This overview contains a project for Omdena's Kenya Chapter.

I was a machine learning engineer intern for this chapter.
The notebooks in this overview are not all my own, rather, this repository serves as a bank of information for the project.

The purpose of this project is to create a crop disease detector for the most popularly grown crops in Kenya.

The following crops were scavenged for images detailing their disease states: Cassava, Beans, Tomatoes, and Maize.

After the collection of data, the images were scaled to an appropriate size ready to train a convolutional neural network.

With AI projects like this, farmers across Kenya can benefit from the massive data available online and use it to help remedy diseases within their crops, consequently helping their economies and communities.
